And when Gyro Gearloose invents a virtual reality headset, Donald and the boys find themselves menaced by fearsome creatures on other worlds. Carl Barks delivers another superb collection of imaginative exuberance, high-concept hijinks, and all-around cartooning brilliance.`,

    "Carl Barks - Only a Poor Old Man",
    "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HdNgGPsCL.jpg",
    `This volume starts off with “Only a Poor Old Man,” the defining Uncle Scrooge yarn (in fact his first big starring story) in which Scrooge’s plan to hide his money in a lake goes terribly wrong. Two other long-form classics in this volume include “Tralla La” (also known as “the bottlecap story,” in which Scrooge’s intrusion has terrible consequences for a money-less eden) and “Back to the Klondike”. Also in this volume are the full-length “The Secret of Atlantis,” and over two dozen more shorter stories and one-page gags.

    Newly recolored in a version that combines the warm, friendly, slightly muted feeling of the beloved classic original comic books with state-of-the-art crispness and reproduction quality, the stories are joined by another volume’s worth of extensive “Liner Notes,” featuring fascinating behind-the-panels essays about the creation of the stories and analyses of their content from a world’s worth of Disney and Barks experts.

    "Carl Barks - The Old Castle's Secret",
    "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817E6PzBM7L.jpg",
    `With this volume, The Complete Carl Barks Disney Library loops back to Barks's earlier days, collecting the entirety of Bark's (astounding) 1948 output. The title story, The Old Castle's Secret, is notable not just for being the first full-length 32-page adventure instigated by Scrooge McDuck (in his second-ever appearance), but for featuring some of Bark's spookiest, lushest settings in old Clan McDuck castle of Dismal Downs. The other long story, The Sheriff of Bullet Valley, plunks Donald and the nephews in the Wild West, with Donald as an overconfident deputy having to deal with some high-tech rustlers. The book also includes the less-known In Darkest Africa, originally published in a giveaway and unreleased for decades. This volume also features an even 10 of Bark's dynamic Walt Disney's Comics and Stories 10-pagers, including Wintertime Wager (the first appearance of a not-yet-lucky-but-still-obnoxious Gladstone Gander); Spoil the Rod (in which the exquisitely named educational professor Pulpheart Clabberhead is brought in to help tame the nephews); Rocket Race to the Moon (a rare full-on adventure interplanetary, no less in the short form); Gladstone Returns and Links Highjinks (two more Gladstone yarns); and five more stories... plus a half-dozen hilarious one-page gags. Of course, once again all the stories have been shot from crisp originals, then re-colored (and printed) to match, for the first time since their original release over 60 years ago, the colorful yet soft hues of the originals and of course the book is rounded off with essays about Barks, the Ducks, and these specific stories by Barks experts from all over the world.`,
